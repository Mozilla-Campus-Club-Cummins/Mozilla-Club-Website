                    Now that you are familiar with what open-source is, let’s look at the different
                    opportunities in store for the aspiring contributors out there. This newsletter will give
                    you a brief idea about the various open-source programs and projects you can
                    participate in and contribute to. <br><br>
                    <a href="https://gssoc.girlscript.tech/">GirlScript Summer of Code(GSSoC)</a>
                    GirlScript Summer Of Code is an open-source program conducted every summer by the
                    Girlscript Foundation. GirlScript Summer of Code would give you a taste of contributing
                    to long open-source projects. Continuously for 3 months, you will contribute to your
                    assigned projects under the guidance of experienced mentors. <br><br>
                    <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/">Google Summer of Code</a>
                    The Google Summer of Code program is a program started by Google and has been
                    conducted for 17 years. It is a program that aims to promote open-source software
                    development among university students. There are a few organizations and these
                    organizations have mentors. First, the organizations apply to Google and after the
                    organizations are selected then the students apply to the organizations. Bear in mind
                    that you are not an employee of Google or even not an intern at Google. You’re working
                    with that organization that you applied to or got selected for. It is a paid program with a
                    stipend of 1500 USD for Medium Size Projects and 3000 USD for Large Size Projects in
                    India. <br><br>
                    <a href="https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/">Google Summer Of Docs</a>
                    One thing that an open-source project cannot get enough of is good documentation.
                    However, Google Season of Docs is a new program by Google where technical writers
                    and open-source organizations come together and work on open-source projects. The
                    technical writers write documentation for open-source organizations and also get paid
                    by Google. It is a worthwhile platform for students to learn from industry experts and to
                    work on open-source projects. Also, you need to remember that you must be aged 18 or
                    older at the time of registration to become eligible for Google Season of Docs. <br><br>

                    Outreachy has internship projects in both open-source and open science. These
                    internship projects may include programming, research, user experience,
                    documentation, graphical design, data science, marketing, user advocacy, or event
                    planning. <br><br>
                    <a href="https://fellowship.mlh.io/">Major League Hacking (MLH) Fellowship</a>
                    The MLH Fellowship is a remote internship alternative for aspiring technologists where
                    you can spend 12 weeks building your skills by collaborating on real-world projects. 3
                    tracks are available for this internship: open-source, software development, and
                    production engineering. A 3-week prep program is also available for absolute beginners. <br> <br>
                    <a href="https://osoc.be/">Open SummerOfCode</a>
                    It is organized by Open Knowledge Belgium. All students will work in teams on different
                    open-source innovation projects provided by partnering organizations, companies, and
                    even governments. You don’t necessarily have to be staying in Belgium to apply for
                    Open Summer of Code, but you have to be allowed to work as a student under Belgian
                    regulation. <br><br>
