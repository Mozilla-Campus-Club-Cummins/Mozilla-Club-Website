                    Resourceful Mondays was an initiative by our Mozilla Campus Club to spread awareness and help students kickstart their open source contribution journey.
                </p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
                    With the aim of making open source more accessible and engaging, the club dedicated every Monday to sharing resources to students, starting from beginners’ guides to advanced tools. This helped learners from all levels to learn something new, beginners to get started and adept students to improve their skills. The resources explored some key aspects like version controls, issue tracking and best practices. The resources were 
                    <br>●	Code Triage</br>
                    <br>●	Code for Gov Tech</br>
                    <br>●	Good First Issue</br>
                    <br>●	Up-For-Grabs</br>
                    <br>●	Eddie Hub</br>
These resources provided opportunities to discover new beginner friendly projects to contribute effectively.

                <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
                   This initiative by the club encouraged students to engage in open source contributions while enhancing their technical skills, collaboration and grow as contributors in the global open source community!
