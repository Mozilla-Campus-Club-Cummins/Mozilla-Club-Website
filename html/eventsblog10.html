                    Merge Mania challenged students with an exciting lineup of four distinct tech-based games. In 'Technical Atlas', participants tested their knowledge; in 'Guess the Word', they competed against the clock; in 'Googler', they demonstrated their expert search abilities and in our tech-themed '20 Questions', participants solved mysteries.
