                    The GitHub Marathon was a week-long, intense sprint organized by the Mozilla Campus Club to help students become experts in version control. We started by providing students with excellent learning materials through mail, enabling them to study everything at their own pace, from fundamental commands to repository management.

                <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
                    And for the final challenge, a short test was conducted where students could demonstrate their abilities and play for a desired place on the event leaderboard. In addition to being a competition, the GitHub Marathon was a significant step in encouraging teamwork and increasing our student body's technical confidence, setting them up for future contributions and projects.
